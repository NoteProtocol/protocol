Unlike other protocols, the NOTE Protocol is genuinely built on Bitcoin's UTXO model. It uses the sCrypt smart contract language, compatible with TypeScript, and compiles to native Bitcoin opcodes. The protocol is Turing complete and supports powerful features such as Oracle integration. The NOTE Protocol also supports on-chain multi-signature, MAST, and the Lightning Network while providing an off-chain environment with state inheritance functionality."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"2-unique-advantages-of-the-note-protocol",children:"2.

The transaction costs are incredibly low, eliminating the need for dual transactions like other protocols. More importantly, the NOTE Protocol supports smart contracts, with its first example contract implementing functionalities such as Bitwork mining and time-decaying mining rewards. This opens up new possibilities beyond Ethereum's EVM smart contracts, leveraging Bitcoin's UTXO model for efficient concurrency and maximum consensus, offering new choices for all blockchain developers. The sCrypt team provides a comprehensive development, compilation, and testing environment, making the development process revolutionary in terms of learning curve, environment setup, fair launch, and complex functionality implementation."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"3-contributing-teams",children:"3.
