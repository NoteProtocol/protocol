## 5. NFT

Due to the vision and technological constraints of the Bitcoin blockchain, this protocol neither mandates nor advises the storage of NFT data directly on the blockchain. It suffices to chain only the HASH of the NFT data, while the data itself may be kept on either decentralized systems with large blocks or centralized platforms.

Tokens crafted under the NOTE protocol bear the name N721, and their Payload is delineated by the rules set forth below.

## TODO

- [ ] Define the Payload for the N721 Token
- [ ] Establish the validation criteria for the N721 Token's Payload
- [ ] Set forth the storage guidelines for the N721 Token's Payload
