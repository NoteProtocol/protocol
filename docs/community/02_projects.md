### Open Source Code Examples

- **[scryptdemo](https://github.com/NoteProtocol/scryptdemo)**: scryptdemo is the first contract code example, providing templates for development and testing. Developers can use it as a basis for their projects. `#OpenSource` `#SmartContract`
- **[scrypt-verify](https://github.com/NoteProtocol/scrypt-verify)**: scrypt-verify is the off-chain contract verification code for the NOTE protocol. It is based on [scryptlib](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/scryptlib) and provides Satoshi Nakamoto's original BVM for contract verification. `#OpenSource` `#SmartContract`
- **[N20 Connect](https://github.com/NoteScan/n20-connect)**: N20 Connect is a frontend wallet connection library for the Bitcoin ecosystem, similar to Wallet Connect. It currently supports several wallets, including UniSat, NoteMarketWallet, and ChainBow Wallet. It provides convenience for DApp development.`#Utility` `#Example` `#OpenSource`
- **[pyNoteMinter](https://github.com/NoteScan/pyNoteMinter)**: Based on pyNoteWallet, pyNoteMinter is optimized for minting tokens on the NOTE protocol.`#Utility` `#Example` `#OpenSource`
- **[N-Deployer](https://n-deployer-test.vercel.app/)**: Deploy your own token of NOTE Protocol.Support connect to NOTE BTC network via ChainBow Wallet, Unisat Wallet and NOTEMarket Wallet (via n20-connect).`#Utility` `#Example` `#OpenSource`
- **[Go-Urchain](https://github.com/xianb/go-urchain)**: Go language client for data services. `#tool` `#opensource`
- **Your Code**: We look forward to more developers open-sourcing their code to help more people understand the NOTE protocol.

### Projects

- **[NOTE.SV](https://note.sv)**: NOTE.SV is a password and encrypted note management software. It encrypts content according to the NOTE protocol and stores it on the blockchain. Each note is encrypted with a different private key, distributed across blockchain nodes worldwide, ensuring secure and permanent content storage. NOTE.SV was the earliest application of the NOTE protocol, with its design inspiring the protocol's creation. `#Application` `#RealWorld`
- **Your Project**: We look forward to your projects, showcasing how blockchain can transform lives and work.

### Tools

- **[Balance Inquiry](https://note.78web3.xyz/)**: A token address balance inquiry tool. The unit of measurement is Zhang = 1000 tokens.
- **[NoteMinter](https://github.com/GoudanWoo/note-minter)**: NoteMinter is a dedicated tool for mining NOTE tokens, written in Go. `#Go` `#OpenSource`
- **[Testnet One-Click Token Issuance](https://note.btc.sv)**: A testnet one-click token issuance website. Many testnet tokens have been deployed using this site. `#Utility`
- **[N20 Bulk Sender](https://bulksender.notenation.io/)**: enabling users to easily send N20 assets in bulk to multiple addresses. The N20 Bulk Sender connects user wallets via the n20-connect project, supporting ChainBow Wallet, Unisat Wallet, and NOTE Market Wallet. it is now fully open-source, and developers can access the complete code at [GitHub](https://github.com/notenationio/N20BulkSender) `#Utility` `#OpenSource`
