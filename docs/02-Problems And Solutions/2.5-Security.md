### 2.5 Security Precautions
As the NOTE protocol is in the initial stages of development, certain limitations are enforced for security purposes.

- Replace-by-Fee (RBF) is forbidden. For inputs adhering to the NOTE protocol and not having the maximum potential value (0xffffffff), indexers should enforce a ban. The sequence numbers for other inputs (like P2WPKH) remain unaffected.
- Priority by Block: Transactions are processed based on the sequence they are incorporated into blocks. In the event of a block reorganization, the block hash is updated. The security of transactions is underpinned by Bitcoin's Layer 1.
- The Principle of Foreseeing: Transactions entering the mempool are promptly identified by indexers, enabling the advance notification to wallets and other client interfaces about invalid transactions to save on unnecessary fees. However, transactions that are broadcasted by force will not be rejected. Wallets and other client interfaces can broadcast transactions via any node.
- Notification of Transactions: Owing to the foresight principle, wallets and other clients are advised to use indexers for transaction broadcasting or to conduct node broadcasts in parallel.
