## 4. Token

The Token, designated as N20, operates under the NOTE protocol framework, with its Payload structured as per specified guidelines. It employs msgpack for plaintext encoding. Each Token encompasses various actions like deployment, minting, and transferring, encapsulated within its data architecture. These actions primarily focus on managing accounts and their balances. Verification by the deploying smart contract is mandatory for each action, ensuring off-chain authentication before any modifications to account balances are allowed. The format for data is designed for flexibility, enabling any additional parameters to be seamlessly integrated and processed by the smart contract.
