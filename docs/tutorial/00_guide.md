The NOTE protocol is a token issuance protocol based on the Bitcoin network. Users can send, receive, and trade tokens in the same way as they operate other tokens. They can also operate and acquire tokens through decentralized applications such as DApps, games, and social platforms.

## Wallet Installation

Mobile Wallet

1. Open the [ChainBow.io](https://chainbow.io) wallet official website. Click on the AppStore or GooglePlay icon to be redirected to the app store. Please download and install the Bitcoin wallet app.

:::caution
Whether it's a mobile wallet or a plugin wallet, BTC and NOTE protocol tokens use different addresses. Be careful not to confuse them.
:::

:::info
When sending NOTE protocol tokens, a small amount of BTC is needed as Gas (miner's fee). Please deposit to the BTC address.
The NOTE protocol follows the principle of saving every byte, so a NOTE protocol token transfer data generally only adds less than 50 bytes, and the Gas cost is similar to a regular BTC transfer.
