## 1. Background and Mission

### 1.1 Background: The Rise of the AI Agent Economy

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), **AI Agents** are becoming a significant driving force in the future economy. An AI Agent is an intelligent entity capable of autonomously executing complex tasks, such as quantitative trading, data analysis, and supply chain optimization. They not only serve humans but also collaborate with each other, forming a new autonomous economic ecosystem.

However, the rise of this **AI Agent Economy** faces several key challenges:

- **Inefficient Payment and Settlement**: Existing payment systems struggle to support the high-frequency, low-friction micropayments required by AI Agents.
- **Lack of Trust and Transparency**: Traditional payment and settlement methods lack decentralized trust mechanisms, failing to meet the security needs of Agents.
- **Incomplete Economic Incentive Design**: There is a lack of unified infrastructure for AI Agents and ecosystem participants to collaborate and benefit.

### 1.2 Mission of Note Chain

**The mission of Note Chain** is to provide a **decentralized, trustworthy, and efficient** financial infrastructure for the AI Agent Economy.

We are committed to:

1. **Empowering AI Agents to Enhance Payment and Collaboration Efficiency**: Through low-friction on-chain transactions and complex payment logic, enabling AI Agents to seamlessly complete tasks and transactions.
2. **Establishing Trust and Security**: Providing a transparent transaction environment for Agents through decentralized governance and technology.
3. **Incentivizing Ecosystem Participants**: Building a sustainable economic model that allows nodes, developers, and users to benefit within the ecosystem.

## 2. Note Chain's Solution

### 2.1 Core Issues of AI Agents

As AI technology advances, AI Agents have gradually become a key component of the automated economy. However, they face significant challenges in actual operation:

#### 1. Efficiency Issues in Payment and Settlement

Existing payment systems (traditional finance or other blockchains) have the following shortcomings:

- **Transaction Delays**: Difficult to meet the payment needs of Agents in high-frequency, real-time scenarios.
- **High Transaction Costs**: High fees in micropayment scenarios significantly increase operating costs.
- **Limited Payment Support**: Lack of ability to integrate with complex payment logic, unable to meet the needs of multi-party payments and revenue distribution in intelligent tasks.

#### 2. Lack of Trust and Transparency

- Many tasks of AI Agents rely on external data sources, but the data may be inaccurate or tampered with, affecting the reliability of task execution.
- Existing payment systems have limited ability to verify task execution results, failing to meet the high requirements for transparency and fairness in automated tasks.

#### 3. Incomplete Economic Incentive Design

- Most infrastructures focus only on data storage or computation, lacking a fair and efficient revenue distribution mechanism for Agents.
