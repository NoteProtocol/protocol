## 4.1 Off-chain Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Bitcoin's advanced smart contract language provided by sCrypt, ensuring that the index validator completes execution within a limited time. Additionally, it supports advanced use cases including Swaps, Oracles, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

Here is a simple example of an off-chain contract:

```typescript
export class N20_Sample extends SmartContract {
    @prop()
    readonly tick: ByteString

    @prop()
    readonly max: bigint

    @prop()
    readonly lim: bigint

    @prop()
    readonly dec: bigint

    constructor(tick: ByteString, max: bigint, lim: bigint, dec: bigint) {
        super(...arguments)
        this.tick = tick
        this.max = max
        this.lim = lim
        this.dec = dec
    }

    @method()
    public mint(tick: ByteString, amt: bigint) {
        assert(tick == this.tick, 'Tick does not match')
        assert(amt <= this.lim, 'Amount check failed')
    }

    @method()
    public transfer(tick: ByteString, amt: bigint) {
        assert(tick == this.tick, 'Tick does not match')
        assert(amt <= this.lim, 'Amount check failed')
    }
}
```

In this code segment, the `check` function verifies whether a Bitcoin transaction exists within the block. The `mint` and `transfer` functions validate whether the two actions of N20 can be executed. Only after the operations pass contract validation will the indexer record changes in the account balances.

### Contract Runtime

During the runtime of the smart contract, the indexer provides constants and environmental variables as follows:

- `account`: ByteString, the initiator's ID (ScriptHash unlocking the UTXO)
- `inputSatoshis`: bigint, the satoshis of the current input (Satoshi amount unlocking the UTXO)
- `height`: bigint, current height; when the transaction is unconfirmed, it is the latest height plus 6
- `blockHash`: ByteString, the hash of the current block, empty string when unconfirmed
- `blockTime`: bigint, the timestamp of the current block, 0 when unconfirmed
- `indexInBlock`: bigint, the index of the current transaction in the block, 0 when unconfirmed
- `indexInChain`: bigint, the index of the current transaction in the chain, 0 when unconfirmed
- `tx`: ByteString, the HEX of the current transaction
- `txId`: ByteString, the ID of the current transaction
- `version`: bigint, the version number of the current transaction, typically 2
- `nLockTime`: bigint, the nLockTime of the current transaction
- `inputs`: array of current transaction inputs, each input includes:
  - `prevTxId`: ByteString, the ID of the previous transaction
  - `outputIndex`: bigint, the output index of the previous transaction
  - `sequenceNumber`: bigint, the unlocking sequenceNumber
- `outputs`: array of current transaction outputs, each output includes:
  - `script`: ByteString, the script of the output
  - `satoshis`: bigint, the satoshis of the output
