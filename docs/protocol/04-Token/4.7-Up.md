## 4.7 Binding UTXO

Binding a UTXO is defined by the following data structure:

```json
{
  "p": "n20",
  "op": "up",
  "tick": "note",
  "v": "1"
}
```

| Key | Required? | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| p | Yes | Protocol name, n20, lowercase |
| op | Yes | Operation name, up, lowercase |
| tick | Yes | Token name, up to 16 bytes, case-insensitive |
| v | Yes | int, integer, version number of the binding |

The unbound token amount in the account will be fully bound to the token address of the first transaction output.
