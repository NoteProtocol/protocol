## 4.3 Deployment

A token is deployed using the following format:

```json
{ 
  "p": "n20",
  "op": "deploy",
  "tick": "note",
  "max": "21000000",
  "lim": "1000",
  "sch": "9fd761f.... ....0a28"
  ... ...
}
```

| Key | Required? | Description |
| :--- | :--- | --- |
| p | Yes | Protocol name, n20, lowercase |
| op | Yes | Operation name, deploy, lowercase |
| tick | Yes | Token name, maximum 12 characters, case-insensitive, cannot be deployed if a token with the same name already exists |
| max | Yes | Bigint, the maximum supply, unlimited if set to 0, checked by the contract |
| lim | Yes | Bigint, the amount per mining, unlimited if set to 0, checked by the contract |
| dec | Yes | Int, number of decimal places, default value is 8
| sch | No | JSON code hash of the smart contract |
| code | No | JSON code of the smart contract |
| ... | No | Other, environment constants required by functions (Mint, Transfer, etc.) during smart contract execution |

The rules for the token name 'tick' are 3 to 12 characters without spaces and must not match the following reserved words (including case sensitivity and Unicode):

```typescript
  /^long$/,
  /^lilong/,
  /^n20$/,
  /^alias$/,
  /^n721$/,
  /^aaa$/,
  /^ggg$/,
  /^wallet$/,
  /^wallet3$/,
  /^notesv/,
  /^note.sv/,
  /^cercle$/,
  /^css$/,
  /^BTC$/,
  /^BSV$/,
  /^BCH$/,
  /^ETH$/,
  /^USD$/,
  /^JPY$/,
  /^EUR$/,
  /^CHAINBOW/,
```

The indexer loads the smart contract using 'sch' or 'code' for operation validation. Only operations that pass validation are recorded by the indexer. If neither 'sch' nor 'code' is provided, no validation is performed.
