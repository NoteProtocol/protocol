## 3.2 Creating Data

The process for creating encrypted data is as follows:

1. Prepare the content of the plaintext data.
2. Use msgpack to package the data.
3. Calculate the SHA256 HASH of the packaged data.
4. Generate a random number, establish a derivation index, and from it derive the encryption private key.
5. Encrypt the data with the derived public key.
6. Perform a Bitcoin Message signature on the encrypted data using the account's private key.
7. Assemble the data script.
8. Construct and broadcast the transaction.
