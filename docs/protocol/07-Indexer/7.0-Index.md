## 7. Indexer

The indexer functions according to a FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, offering a transaction queue that adheres to this ordering. Transactions are initially logged in the mempool's queue. Subsequently, the first input of each transaction undergoes individual inspection. Only transactions validated by BTC consensus, affirming their compliance, are queued.
This process involves verifying the validity of input data signatures, ensuring the accuracy and legitimacy of amounts, and determining the feasibility of passing off-chain smart contract validations.

Following the confirmation of assets, the system generates a Merkle proof for the block at that moment. The Merkle tree is altered with each transaction confirmation.
