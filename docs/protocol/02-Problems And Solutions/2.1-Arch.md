### 2.1 System Overview

The diagram below illustrates that asset private keys are created and safeguarded either in the user's wallet or in corresponding software applications. When transactions involving data assets are broadcasted to the blockchain, it guarantees the transparency and irreversibility of the information, establishing the timing, sequence, and ownership of transactions through the verification of blocks. Data indexers and validators play a crucial role in decoding transaction data, implementing smart contracts off the blockchain, and issuing Merkle proofs for the assets.
