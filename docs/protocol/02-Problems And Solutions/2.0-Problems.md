Based on the characteristics of the UTXO model blockchain, this protocol resolves the following problems:

- Decentralized Identity (DID)
- Data Format
- Data Storage Location
- Data Ownership Verification
- Ownership Transfer
- On-chain Contracts
- Data Parsing
- Data Indexing
- Asset Creation
- Asset Mining
- Asset Transfer
- Asset Notification
- Asset Proof

During the design process, transaction sequence was considered to avoid double-spending, reduce redundancy of on-chain data, and prevent asset loss.
