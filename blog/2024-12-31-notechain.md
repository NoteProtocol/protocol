  - Achieved low-cost transactions and efficient UTXO asset management

- **Technical Upgrades (April)**:
  - Expanded Payload data storage capacity
  - Introduced N20 Token Burn functionality
  - Enhanced off-chain contract execution environment with block and transaction information
  - Completed indexer code refactoring

- **Theoretical Breakthroughs (June)**:
  - Proved and demonstrated Bitcoin script's Turing completeness
  - Innovatively solved the halting problem in smart contracts
  - Optimized script storage space to 2.5K

- **Ecosystem Expansion (July)**:
  - Released complete smart contract development framework
  - Launched first practical application based on NOTE Protocol
  - Initiated N721 NFT and Alias DID protocol development

- **Interaction Innovation (Late July)**:
  - Released Bitcoin Action protocol
  - Achieved seamless wallet-dApp interaction
  - Simplified user operations and improved experience

- **Protocol Upgrades (Late November)**:
  - Implemented Alias public key alias protocol
  - Implemented N721 NFT asset protocol
  - Integrated NOSTR protocol

## Technology Outlook for 2025

Building on 2024's achievements, NOTE Protocol will begin a new chapter in 2025, focusing on building infrastructure for the AI agent economy. We have submitted the [Note Chain Whitepaper Draft](/docs/research/chain) and completed the first codebase implementation, focusing on AI Agent DAG workflow engine ([Repository](https://github.com/NoteProtocol/dag-workflow)).

### AI Agent Economy Infrastructure

- **High-Performance Layer 1 Blockchain**:
  - Implement high-concurrency transaction processing based on UTXO model
  - Ensure network security and efficiency through DPoS consensus
  - Support smart contracts and complex workflow execution

- **Decentralized Oracle System**:
  - Multi-node collaboration for external data acquisition and validation
  - Support diverse data sources including market prices and IoT device status
  - Real-time triggering of AI agent workflows

- **Distributed Workflow Engine**:
  - Support AI Agent task smart contract deployment
  - Enable parallel task processing and state management
  - Ensure execution result trustworthiness through consensus

### Economic Model Innovation

- **NUST Stablecoin System**:
  - Issue native stablecoin supporting AI agent economy
  - Enable high-frequency micropayments and complex payment logic
  - Establish cross-chain asset interoperability standards

- **Incentive Mechanism Design**:
  - Reward nodes based on task complexity
  - Distribute earnings for ecosystem development participation
  - Implement user staking and governance rights system

### Ecosystem Development

- **Developer Tools**:
  - Enhance smart contract development framework
  - Provide workflow template library
  - Establish developer incentive program

- **Cross-chain Interoperability**:
  - Support multi-chain asset integration
  - Unified payment standards
  - Inter-chain data communication

Our goal is to build a high-performance blockchain infrastructure serving 6 billion people, enabling AI agents to collaborate efficiently and complete complex tasks securely and reliably. Note Chain will become a crucial bridge connecting AI, blockchain, and the real world.

**Let's work together to build an intelligent, open, and prosperous blockchain future!**
